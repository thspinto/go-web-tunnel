	Short: "Generate bash completion",
	Long: `This command will generate a Bash script for enable the go-web-tunnel autocompletion.
	Make sure that you have https://github.com/scop/bash-completion properly installed.
	You can verify by running type _init_completion.
	If the previus command succeeds, you're already set, otherwise click the above link and follow the installation guide.

	Now add the completion script genereted by running go-web-tunnel completion bash in your /etc/bash_completion.d
	running the following command:
		$ sudo sh -c  "go-web-tunnel completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/go-web-tunnel" "

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// bashCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// bashCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
