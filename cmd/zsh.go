	The go-web-tunnel completion script for Zsh can be generated with this command.
	Sourcing the completion script in your shell will enable go-web-tunnel autocompletion.
	To do so in all your shell sessions, add the following to your ~/.zshrc
		$ sudo sh -c "go-web-tunnel completion zsh > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_go-web-tunnel"  \
		&& echo "autoload -U compinit && compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// zshCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// zshCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
